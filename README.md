- Reads farmer and product data.
- Builds dynamic cart payloads.
- Sends `PUT` API requests.
- Tracks upload status and API responses.
- One-click upload via a custom Google Sheets menu.

## üìÇ Sheet Structure

| Sheet Name         | Purpose                                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Extract 1`        | Master data: all farmer cart details.                                             |
| `ToUploadFarmers`  | Farmers pending upload (`farmerId` list).                                         |
| `FarmerCartStatus` | (Auto-created) Log sheet: upload results, product count, and API responses.       |

## üõ† How It Works

1. **Custom Menu**: Adds a `Upload Cart` menu ‚Üí one-click upload.
2. **Mapping**: Matches farmers between `Extract 1` and `ToUploadFarmers`.
3. **Status Management**:  
   - Already uploaded? ‚Üí Skipped.  
   - Not found? ‚Üí Marked as "Not Found".  
   - Successfully uploaded? ‚Üí Marked as "Uploaded".
4. **Logging**: All actions logged in `FarmerCartStatus` sheet.

## üì° API Request Details

- **Method**: `PUT`
- **Headers**:
  - `source`: Product source (dynamic).
  - `x-authorization-token`: Your API token.
- **Payload Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "farmerId": "string",
    "source": "string",
    "products": [
      {
        "productName": "string",
        "skuCode": "string",
        "quantity": number,
        "appliedOffer": "string",
        "isAdding": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Example Endpoint**: `https://httpbin.org/put` (for safe testing)

## üéØ Why This Approach?

- **Non-technical Friendly**: One menu click uploads everything.
- **Safe & Idempotent**: Skips already-uploaded farmers automatically.
- **Transparent**: Full upload logs with API responses.
- **Fast**: Optimized for minimal reads/writes inside the sheet.
